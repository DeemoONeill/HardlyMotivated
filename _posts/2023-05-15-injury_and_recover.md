## Injury and Recovery

### How it started

During 2020 when we were all stuck in doors, I was writing my thesis. I spent a lot
of time sat down and not moving. One day I sat down on the living room sofa and something
in my back popped. I could barely move, I could barely stand. I couldn't get off the sofa
unaided. I ended sliding myself onto the floor. rolling onto all fours and levering myself up
using the side of the sofa.

This was also during lockdown. I couldn't see a doctor, I couldn't see anyone. I ended up
calling the doctor and getting prescribed some hard core pain medication over the phone.
It took weeks until I could move properly again. I was in agony. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't
exercise. I couldn't work.

Eventually I recovered, but what should have been a kick up the arse to get fit and healthy
ended up not being anything. I had to sit at my computer and finish writing my thesis. Due
to the pain going away I didn't think any more about it.

My partner and I ended up getting into walking, not long walks, just 3 or so miles every couple
of days to get out of the house and get some fresh air. We needed it for our mental health as
much as anything.

My life moved on, I finished my PhD, I got a job, moved house and fell back into the habit
of sitting at my desk all day, not moving. I really enjoy working from home, I get a lot done
despite the name of this blog. But I think even walking around the office and going out for
long would be better.

### How it's going

It's now 2023, I was visiting my brother and his family for the coronation weekend and went
camping in their garden, and on day number two while playing a game of tag with the kids,
something went in my back again. Agony once again.

This time however, It has been the kick up the arse I needed. That same day we drove home,
I didn't think another night in a tent would be a good idea, I got the last of my strong
pain meds out of the medicine cabinet and had a horrible nights sleep. This followed by my
partner needing to help me get out of bed in the morning.

Most of the pain has gone now, I'm still not 100% but I'm getting there. I've been doing
some stretches and exercises to help strengthen my back and core. I've been walking, changing
my posture, swapping between sitting and standing at my desk.

The plan now is to keep this up, make sure I don't fall back into bad habits and strengthen
my postural muscles with daily exercise and stretches.
This post is a reminder to myself to keep this up, and to keep me accountable.

### On accountability

While I was in the final year of my PhD, I got a gym buddy. He would pick me up
4 days a week from my house and took me under his wing for powerlifting. I wasn't
great at it, I was pulling sets of 115kg deadlifts, 80kg squats and 70kg bench press.
But I was getting stronger and I was enjoying it. But I was also accountable to him,
once he was at my house I had to go. I couldn't just leave him sitting outside.
It ended up being a great routine, I was intrinsically motivated to go, but I was also
extrinsically motivated to not let him down. It also ended up helping me keep my day
organised. There were days we would arrive on campus, I would run off to the lab to
kick off one my experiments I had set up the previous night and head back to the gym
for a couple of hours. I could then have breakfast in my office and head down to the
lab to check on my experiment.

If there was something I would change about working from home it would be having some
way of adding in a workout or something like that to my morning. I've started off
with exercises easy to do at home (see the notes at the end of this post), but the plan
is once I've gotten into the habit of doing those, and the final twinges of back pain
have subsided, I'll be joining the powerlifting gym that's a short cycle from my house.
Hopefully I can get these postural muscles strong enough to avoid this happening again.

Thanks for reading.

Notes:
A couple of days after I got home [a guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/07/life-changing-daily-moves-that-will-keep-your-body-happy)
showed up on the firefox new tab page about daily movements to keep your body happy.
I do these a couple of times a day now, especially when I realise I've been sat down for
too long. They are quite fun.

Github copilot is suggesting I add this to the end of the post maybe I'll give it a go:
I've also been doing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOTvaRaDjI) every day.

Copilot is also convinced I love running for some reason.
